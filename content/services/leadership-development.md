Brought in by newly appointed CEO of a communications start-up to mobilize his top team preparatory to taking the business public.  Facilitated creation of a vision statement and an ambitious business plan; provided leadership development using experiential methods.  All business objectives subsequently achieved.

Led launch, within Asia, of a workshop on ethical strategic influencing (mindset and skill-set). Originally designed in the US, anchored in research within US-headquartered multinationals, and built around a live business case, deliveries in Asia entailed surfacing and working through cross-cultural issues that bear on global business practices. 

Commissioned to design and deliver, to a global financial services client's internal HR assessors, a one day masterclass, Attachment at Work. Provided an overview of the theory and research; offered organizational case applications; facilitated discussion about ways in which participants might make practical use of this theory, at work.
