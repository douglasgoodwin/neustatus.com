Called in by HR Director to address perceived personality clash between newly appointed Director of International and other department heads. Identified and surfaced underlying political and cross-cultural issues; worked these through with key players and achieved no-cost resolution accepted by all parties. 

Approached by Chairman of the Board to address poor communication and low morale within a key business group.  Established consulting contract with the Chief Executive, who had direct line authority over this group.  Conducted confidential one-to-one interviews; facilitated a set of workshops that enabled participants to air and work through "undiscussables," take tough but necessary decisions, and rebuild trust.

Engaged by former coaching client to assist with an internal start-up, transforming a business concept into a live, value-add operational unit within an established multinational corporation.  Provided ongoing support in recruitment, individual and team coaching. In its first 2 years the unit grew to 100 employees and achieved its profit target.

Selected by Chief Executive to consult on design and implementation of an OD initiative to support doubling his pan-European division's revenue and profit in 4 years. To maximize engagement, the initiative was launched through an employee survey; results fed into in-country business strategy workshops, outputs from which were incorporated into the design of a division-wide strategic planning conference. A robust new business vision was framed to drive sustainable, profitable growth, to facilitate determination of consistent management priorities locally and internationally, and to nurture innovation as a value in this business's historically risk-averse culture.
