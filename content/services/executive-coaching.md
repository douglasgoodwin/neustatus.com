Selected as coach by newly appointed COO within a regulatory agency with the explicit aim of catalyzing his learning and development to enable his further advancement; one year later, he was appointed to the role of Chief Executive.

Chosen as coach by ‘high potential’ senior manager. Just as our work began, she was faced with the prospect of job loss due to a coinciding organizational restructure.  Provided transition support; within 6 months she had generated several job options and secured a new role at Director level.

Selected by high-performing client-handler, within a global financial services firm, to address colleagues' concerns about his behavior and style. Intensive coaching focused on modifying behavior as well as surfacing and addressing underlying causes. His next annual appraisal, which included an element of 360-degree feedback, was outstanding; he was duly promoted to the role of Managing Director.
